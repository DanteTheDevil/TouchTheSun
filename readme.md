## Touch The Sun

This is a 5 days weather forecast of any city of the world. Here you can check temperature, humidity, preassure, wind and weather type for every 3 hours of a day. All data are actual for the local timezone. This project was implemented for the next purposes:
1. Show my pure javascript skills on the Eleks FrontEnd Camp 2018.
2. Help non-developers, who want to check weather forecast.
3. Help developers, who are interested in development of a similar project, but dont know what to start with.

Demo is availiable on gitHub pages: [demo](https://dantethedevil.github.io/TouchTheSun/).
